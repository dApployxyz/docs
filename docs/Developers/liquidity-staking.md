# Liquidity Staking

Creating a liquidity staking pool has several advantages, here is an overview.
-Truly creating a decentralized organization with crowd dispersed LP tokens. This method ensures not a single LP holder retains monetary. Creating the liquidity pool on dApploy offers the benefit of everyone to hold a share of value and ensure the spread of LP available for future trading.
-Instant utility for public use. Upon creating LP anyone can launch the liquidity staking pool at anytime. Doing this will give investors utility ready for use and yield. 
-Increasing project TVL. During the deposit phase of the liquidity pool users will have options to lock for different periods of time. Longer lock times yields higher bonuses, creating incentive to increase project TVL.
