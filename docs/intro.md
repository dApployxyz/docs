Learn how to deploy any dApploy developer tool in ** less than 5 minutes**.

## What is dApploy?
The 1inch Network (https://1inch.io/) unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest, and protected operations in the DeFi space by offering access to hundreds of liquidity sources across multiple chains. The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol v1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

## Why do we exist?
We think that traditional methods of launching a successful token and creating trust around it are far too difficult and expensive. Without Team Finance, a company that wants to launch a token will usually have to go through the following steps:
Hire a developer to create their token (3+ months to find and contract the dev + $10,000 to create the contract)
Hire an audit firm to check the smart contract (3+ month wait time, $10,000-$50,000)
Use a multisender tool to send money out to investors ($150 per batch)
Marketing to prove trust and legitimacy ($10,000-$100,000)
Because of the time and costs, most companies donâ€™t implement the above steps. They cut corners. This makes them vulnerable to bugs in their contracts and rogue team members.
This is why we see so many scams and hacks in web3 today. Tokens are way too hard to setup and build trust around. We want to help companies grow faster and create the projects of tomorrow. For this, they need infrastructure that is affordable, easy to use, and flexible.
